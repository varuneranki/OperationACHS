data scraper from sub Reddit r/Hidradenitis


## Why this project exists?
This project is aimed towards analyzing data from sub Reddit r/Hidradenitis for gathering the age groups Hidradenitis that are affected from the disease Hidradenitis Suppurativa or Acne Inversa. 

This project uses Python Reddit API Wrapper(PRAW) as described in the [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/scraping-reddit-data-1c0af3040768)

Main aims for this project is the find the various applicable cures based on the stage of disease. For retreiving the information related to cures, we need to first make a detailed map of anonymous users, their ages, cures tried, number of dermatologists visited, time period of disease, mental health, family ties, stress level-occupation, personal life, any holistic cures tried, many more categories. Based on these data points, extrapolation should be done to current studies. General information that exists states 4% of World's population suffers from this disease. 7:3 ratio exists between female:male. In a personal context, the world ratio could be much higher than 4% and gender disparity could be skewed since most males suffering from this disease have no outoging attitude and often misdiagnosed. Since not a lot of data exists on this relatively new disease, we go by the assumption that there is NO CURE and all we have is some HOPE if at all a cure exists in hollistic methods apart from Allopathic medicine. 

There needs to be a facebook spider/crawler as well as most support groups exist older than reddit.
